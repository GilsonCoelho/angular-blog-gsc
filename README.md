# Project created from DIO's course on Angular

Reference project on GitHub [Felipe Aguiar](https://github.com/felipeAguiarCode/angular-blog).
Teaching the first steps to create a responsive screen in Angular.

# AngularBlogGsc

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.2.0.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Project under construction

The final idea is to connect it with the backend (JAVA) using the Rest API.
